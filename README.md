The device that acts as the server is the GitHub repository that you made.
Bobs Browser requests the content through the internet. Which goes through a process involving the use of both you and Bob's ISP's, Wifi, and Routers, as well as satellites and optic fiber cables that allow electric signals to travel throughout the world so we can send anything to anyone regardless of location.
The server goes through Bob's client and opens up the server in the client.
