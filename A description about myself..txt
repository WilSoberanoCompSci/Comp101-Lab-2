A description about myself.

I am Wilson Soberano, a second year at Capilano University. My CapU program is the Associates Degree of Science, which means that this is my second and potentially final year at Capilano, it depends on if I am able to get my credit and requirements completed. Maybe I will go through a third year if things don't go so well. Who knows?
